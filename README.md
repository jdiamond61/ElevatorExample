# ElevatorExample
## Outside Analytics Summer 24' internship interview project.
### Author: Jackson Diamond
Code that simulates an elevator. \
The result is a python executable that can be run with the provided inputs and generate the requested outputs. \
I just got done with my midterms so applogies for the delay and getting this done. 

### Assumptions
-Single floor travel time = 10. \
-Coded in Python.\
-Error checking for bad user inputs. \
-Keep running until given proper inputs.

### Sample run terminal interface:
(User entries) \
Enter the starting floor: 12\
Enter the floors to visit (comma-separated): 2,9,1,32\
\
(Output when given proper input) \
Total travel time: 560\
Floors visited in order: [12, 2, 9, 1, 32]
